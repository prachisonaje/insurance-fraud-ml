# Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains real-world, imbalanced data with both numerical and categorical features.

## Workflow
- Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection and Outlier Handling
- Encoding and Preprocessing
- Model Training 
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Compare models
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- scipy

## Results
The models were compared using accuracy and fraud recall. The final model was selected based on an accuracy–recall trade-off suitable for imbalanced data.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
